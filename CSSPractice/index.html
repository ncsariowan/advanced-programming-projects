                <img alt="this guy is taking a selfie" src="https://media.wired.com/photos/598e35fb99d76447c4eb1f28/master/pass/phonepicutres-TA.jpg">
                <div>
                    <p>This is just normal paragraph text...the important thing is that it
                        flows around that photo on the left. Something about lorem and
                        ipsum.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is another short, normal paragraph that is also flowing
                        around the image on the left...this paragraph should finish
                        before the image does (so that there is height left in the image)
                        and <a href="http://xkcd.com" target="_blank">have a link</a> in it.
                    </p>

            <div>
                <p>
                    This is yet another normal paragraph but this one should only start after/below the image...it
                    should be
                    clear
                    of the &quot;flow around the image&quot; part. Include a
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://corndog.io/">link</a> or
                    <a  target="_blank" href="https://trypap.com/">two</a>.

                <h2>Not Centered, Blue, Slightly Smaller Heading/Section Title (Self-Described Style)</h2>
                <p>The description above applies to the size of the heading. The heading above should be smaller than
                    the
                    heading at the top of the page. Next is a list...but with letters instead of numbers. Look up the
                    CSS
                    property
                    <i>list-style-type</i> for help.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>List Item 1</li>
                    <li>List Item 2</li>
                    <li>List Item 3</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div id="half-section" class="flex-container">
                <div id="green-div">
                    <p>
                        This section should be exactly 50% of the width of
                        the page and on the left. It should have a
                        background color and a border color (you choose
                        colors and the width of the border). There should
                        also be space (one might call it padding) between
                        the text and the border. Make the space 20 pixels
                        on the sides but only 10 pixels above and below.
                        Note that I didn&#39;t try to model the padding
                        here...your page should have it. Oh...and
                        <a href="http://www.movenowthinklater.com/" target="_blank"> links in these two sections </a>
                        (see the right) should be red
                        instead of blue (they should be blue elsewhere on
                        this page).
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="orange-div">
                    <p>
                        This is similar to the section on the left but it is on the
                        right. It should have different colors than the one on
                        the left. These two sections should have the same
                        height (regardless of how much text is in it) and the
                        same padding. There is no margin between these two
                        sections or between the section and the edge of the
                        page.
                        <a href="http://www.rrrgggbbb.com/" target="_blank">Red link because it said the links in
                            these</a>
                        sections should be red.

            <div>
                <p>
                    I want to emphasize <span class="highlighted">some words</span> or <span
                        class="highlighted">phrases</span> with CSS. Create a class and use it on some span tags to
                    create
                    an effect like <span class="highlighted">what you see</span> here (different background color on
                    just
                    part of the paragraph, like a
                    highlighter).
