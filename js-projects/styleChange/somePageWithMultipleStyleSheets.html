						<h2>Changing a StyleSheet Without Reloading</h2>
						<p>The goal of this challenge is to have the page
						load different style sheets based on button clicks. The style sheet is loaded in the &lt;head&gt; tag, specifically inside of the &lt;link&gt; tag.</p>
						
						<p>Add onclick attributes to the buttons below so that they change the stylesheet associated with the page. You will also need to create two different stylesheet files (e.g. blah.css and foo.css) to be used with this challenge; you will most likely want to put these files in the same directory as this file.
						</p>
						<p>Note: you don't need to create <strong>light</strong> and <strong>dark</strong> themes; you can choose any two themes that you want. If you want to do <strong>cat</strong> and <strong>dog</strong> themes, go for it.
						</p>
						<p>When you are finished, come show me the results; do not email me the files.</p>

						<button onclick="document.getElementById('style').href='light.css';">Light Style Sheet</button>
